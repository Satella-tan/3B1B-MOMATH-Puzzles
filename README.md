# MoMath Mindbenders Solvers

A collection of programs, simulations, and interfaces built to explore and solve the monthly "Mindbenders" puzzles curated by Peter Winkler and presented by **3Blue1Brown** and **MoMath**.

##  Goal
The goal of this repo is to approach each month's challenge programmatically, whether through simulations, algorithms, or interactive visualizations.
