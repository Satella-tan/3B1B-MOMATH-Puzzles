#  Problem:

A ladybug lands on the 12 of a clock,and every second, she moves randomly to a neighboring number, either one step clockwise or one step counterclockwise. Here, each time she touches a number, I'm coloring it red. And on this run of the simulation, the last number to get colored is three. And if I run the simulation a second time again, where she continues until every number is colored,
the last one to get colored is one. 

> **Puzzle**: What is the probability that the very last number to get colored is the six?

### My base answer

Just by logic, 12 cannot be the last number to get colored. Therefore the answer is 1/11. However, we also know that the second number to get colored (the first step in whatever direction) also will not be the last. Because is guaranteed that it will pick a direction. So my answer at the top of my head is 1/10.
